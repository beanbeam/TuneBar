TuneBar
=======

A small status bar utility for macOS that displays the title
and artist of the currently playing song in iTunes.

There are a bunch of similar programs, but none of them
worked quite the way I wanted, so I wrote this.

When nothing is playing it appears as a small blank space on
the status bar. This is intentional, but can make it hard to
find if you don't know where it should be.
